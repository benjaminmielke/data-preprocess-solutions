This is a link to my Google Drive of a folder that contains an example of ETL that I completed on a test data set. 

I use an efficient and effective process of folder creation that ensures no errors are missed and data is preprocessed correctly and thoroughly before being loaded into an SQL database. 

The original file is put into an Original Data folder where it will not be touched any further. 
The data is then copied into a Prepared Data folder where processing is completed using Notepad++ and SSIS. 
Once preparation is completed, the data is copied into the Uploaded Data folder which is used to load into SQL using SSIS.

The Analysis folder contains records or Manually and Automatically discovered/corrected data records. 

In this problem, the data file is too large to upload into Excel to convert data types into correct formats, therefore, the data was split into two to complete this step.
